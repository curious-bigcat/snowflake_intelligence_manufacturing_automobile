📄 Snowflake AI Data Cloud for Manufacturing & Automobiles

This document, presented by Bharath Suresh, Senior Partner Solutions Engineer at Snowflake 1, outlines how Snowflake addresses complex technology challenges and enables data agility in the Manufacturing and Automobiles sectors through its Data & AI Platform2222222.


1. Complex Technology Challenges: Barriers to Transformation

The presentation identifies several complex technology challenges that act as barriers to transformation3:

Data Silos Across the Enterprise: Fragmented and siloed data scattered across various systems and clouds4. The traditional hardware-centric era is described as siloed, separating functions like R&D, Supply Chain, Manufacturing (MFG), Vehicle, Dealer, Finance, Customer, Marketing, and After Sales/Service5.


Connected Factory Vehicle Data Volume: Difficulty in managing high-volume connected data6. The path to software-centricity is challenging due to the complex web of systems (e.g., Engineering, Manufacturing, Product/Validation, Connected Products) and functional areas (e.g., R&D, Supply Chain, MFG) that need integration7777.


Developing New Revenue Streams: Obstacles in launching high-value services that are driven by data8.


Scalable AI: Difficulties in effectively scaling AI across various teams9.
